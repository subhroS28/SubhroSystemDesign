**💡 Real Example:**
> **Online Gaming Platform** - League of Legends uses Layer 4 load balancing to distribute game connections based on IP and port, ensuring players connect to the nearest game server with minimal latency.

---

### 6. 🧠 Layer 7 Load Balancing (Application Layer)

**What it is:** Routes traffic based on application content (HTTP headers, URLs, cookies)

**Decision Factors:**
- HTTP headers (User-Agent, Content-Type)
- URL paths (/api/users, /api/orders)
- Cookies (session IDs, user preferences)
- Request content and methods

| Pros ✅ | Cons ❌ |
|---------|---------|
| **Intelligent routing** - Application-aware decisions | **Higher latency** - Deep packet inspection |
| **Advanced features** - SSL termination, compression | **Resource intensive** - More CPU/memory usage |
| **Content-based routing** - Route by URL, headers | **Complex configuration** - Requires application knowledge |
| **Session persistence** - Maintain user sessions | **Protocol specific** - Primarily HTTP/HTTPS |

**🎯 Perfect For:**
- **Microservices architecture** - Route by API endpoints
- **Web applications** - Content-based routing
- **E-commerce platforms** - Session management

**💡 Real Example:**
> **Microservices E-commerce** - Uber Eats uses Layer 7 load balancing to route `/restaurant` requests to restaurant service, `/payment` to payment service, and `/delivery` to delivery tracking service.

2. DNS returns different server IPs based on policy
3. Client connects directly to assigned server

| Pros ✅ | Cons ❌ |
|---------|---------|
| **Simple implementation** - No special hardware needed | **Slow updates** - DNS caching delays |
| **Geographic distribution** - Route by user location | **No health awareness** - Can route to failed servers |
| **Cost-effective** - Uses existing DNS infrastructure | **Limited policies** - Basic routing options |
| **Global reach** - Works anywhere with DNS | **Session issues** - No session persistence |

**🎯 Perfect For:**
- **Content delivery** - Route to nearest CDN edge
- **Simple geographic routing** - Basic global distribution
- **Budget-conscious solutions** - Minimal infrastructure cost

**💡 Real Example:**
> **CDN Provider** - Cloudflare uses DNS load balancing to direct users to the closest edge server. Users in India get Mumbai servers, US users get US servers, reducing latency by 60%.

### 8. 🌐 Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)

**What it is:** Advanced DNS load balancing with health checks and intelligent routing across data centers

**Enhanced Features:**
- Server health monitoring
- Performance-based routing
- Disaster recovery automation
- Custom routing policies

| Pros ✅ | Cons ❌ |
|---------|---------|
| **Multi-datacenter failover** - Automatic disaster recovery | **Complex setup** - Requires specialized knowledge |
| **Performance optimization** - Routes to best-performing site | **Higher costs** - Specialized hardware/software |
| **Health awareness** - Monitors server/site status | **DNS limitations** - Still subject to DNS caching |
| **Advanced policies** - Custom routing rules | **Vendor dependency** - Requires GSLB appliances |

**🎯 Perfect For:**
- **Global enterprises** - Multiple data centers worldwide
- **Mission-critical applications** - Zero downtime requirements
- **High-traffic websites** - Need optimal global performance

**💡 Real Example:**
> **Global Social Media Platform** - Facebook uses F5 GSLB to route users to the closest healthy data center. If the US East coast data center fails, traffic automatically redirects to US West coast, ensuring seamless user experience.
