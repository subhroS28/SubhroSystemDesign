What's Load Balancing All About?
Think of load balancing like a traffic cop at a busy intersection. Instead of letting all cars go through one lane (which would create a massive jam), the cop directs traffic across multiple lanes to keep things flowing smoothly.
In system design, a load balancer sits between users and your servers, distributing incoming requests across multiple servers instead of overwhelming just one.
Why Do We Need It?
Core Problems It Solves:

Single Point of Failure: Without load balancing, if your one server crashes, your entire application goes down
Server Overload: One server handling all traffic will eventually buckle under pressure
Poor Performance: Users experience slow response times when servers are overwhelmed

Real Example: Imagine Netflix had only one server. During peak hours (like Friday nights), millions of users would hit that single server, causing crashes and buffering issues for everyone.
Where to Place Load Balancers (3 Strategic Locations)

Between Users & Web Servers

First line of defense
Example: When users visit amazon.com, load balancer decides which web server handles their request


Between Web Servers & Application Servers

Internal traffic distribution
Example: Your web server needs to call payment processing service - load balancer picks which payment server to use


Between Application Layer & Database

Database query distribution
Example: Your app needs user data - load balancer chooses which database replica to query



How It Actually Works (Simple 5-Step Process)
Let's say you're opening Instagram:

You click Instagram app → Request goes to load balancer
Load balancer thinks: "Which server is least busy right now?"
Forwards your request → Sends it to Server #3 (least loaded)
Server #3 processes → Gets your feed data and sends back
Load balancer delivers → You see your Instagram feed

Key Concepts You Must Know
Health Checks: Load balancer constantly pings servers asking "Are you alive and working?"

If server says "I'm dying" → Removed from pool
If server recovers → Added back to pool

Session Persistence: Keeping you connected to same server

Example: Your shopping cart items stay consistent because you're always talking to the same server

SSL/TLS Termination: Load balancer handles encryption/decryption

Benefit: Backend servers focus on business logic instead of security overhead

Real-World Analogy
Restaurant Example:

Load Balancer = Host at restaurant entrance
Backend Servers = Different dining sections
Health Checks = Host checking if sections are too crowded
Algorithms = Host's strategy (send families to family section, couples to quiet area)

When you arrive, the host doesn't randomly seat you. They check which section has space, which servers are overwhelmed, and direct you accordingly.
Interview-Ready Points
When asked "Why use load balancers?":

Prevents single point of failure
Improves performance through distribution
Enables horizontal scaling
Provides redundancy

When asked "Where would you place them?":

User-facing layer (web servers)
Internal services layer (microservices)
Data layer (database replicas)

Key Takeaway
Load balancing is like having multiple cashiers at a supermarket instead of one. It prevents long queues, handles peak traffic better, and if one cashier goes on break, others keep serving customers. Essential for any system expecting real traffic!
